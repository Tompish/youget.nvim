INTRODUCTION                                                    *youget.nvim*

youget.nvim is a plugin for handling nuget packages. 

SETUP

The setup function accepts a single table. It is not mandatory to call
setup. 
There are no default keybindings! These must be mapped like the rest
of your keybinding by neovims keymaps. E.g.
>
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>nu', require('youget').update, {})
<

FUNCTIONALITY

youget.add														*youget.add()*
	Adds a new nuget package to the project. It is done by opening a fuzzy search window
	that displays available packages. If there are multiple project files
	in a solution, the project file where packages are to be added must be
	the active buffer.
>
require('youget').add()
<

youget.update														*youget.update()*
	Updates a package to the latest available version. The line under the cursor
	is the target of the update. 
	This is useful when bumping nuget references from a private artifactory.
>
require('youget').update()
<

youget.choose														*youget.choose()*
	Choose the package version. The line under the cursor is the target of
	the update. Opens a fuzzy search window that displays available versions.

require('youget').choose()
